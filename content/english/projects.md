# [Podręczniki z Samorządem](https://podreczniki.skica.dev)

![Podręczniki z Samorządem Preview](/projects/podreczniki.png)  
Until now, used textbooks in our school were traded wildly - random posts with price lists on the Facebook group were commonplace, and the organization of the fair was always an overwhelming task. In September, long conversations and scheduling meetings with other random students couldn’t be avoided to get the whole set of books.

Not anymore! [Maks](https://skica.dev) and I designed a platform that connects buyers with owners of unnecessary textbooks - but this is not a regular shopping website. An important role in the transaction is played by the Student Council, which is a trusted third party, accepting textbooks for sale, assigning them grades and processing orders. Students can easily compare prices and choose the right set for them.

SC charges a commission for its participation, which allows it to cover operating costs. Unfortunately, we have not implemented online payments due to tax complications.

***Used technologies: Django, jQuery, Bootstrap, Heroku.***

Tens of thousands of tourists come to Wrocław every month. But none of them has any idea what to visit. Churches, churches, churches …

As part of the [Zwolnieni z Teorii](https://zwolnienizteorii.pl/) competition, our team is preparing an application that allows users to discover exciting places selected by native Wrocław residents.

 Again, [Maks](https://skica.dev) was responsible for backend, whereas I made the Flutter application.

# [BetterMemorySugarBot](https://github.com/Simon-the-Shark/BetterMemorySugarBot)
![BetterMemorySugarBot Preview](/projects/bettermemorysugarbot.png)  
It was created for personal need of main in order to receive notifications, handful in managing my first type diabetes. I don't use it anymore, because I've changed my pump and the systems I use.   

One of my first Django real-world app. Also it's a DIY project, so I wanted to use only completely free resources. And that's why it's definitely overcomplicated. Nevertheless it has complete tutorial with screenshots and some functional tests.

***Used technologies: Django, Bootstrap, Heroku, Atrigger, IFTTT***
