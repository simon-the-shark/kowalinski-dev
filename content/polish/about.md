# My programming story  
 I started learning Python when I was 14 years old. I signed up for extra Python classes at the very beginning of my middle-high school, but then after a few lessons, I started learning on my own. 
 
 Since then, I have explored various aspects of this language, starting from simple games, through GUI applications, finally to Django apps. And I just fell in love with this gorgeous framework.  
 
 Moreover, I got familiar with some frontend technologies, so I like to think of myself as a Fullstack Web Developer. If it sounds funny to you (considering my age and experience), check out some of my [Projects]({{< ref "projects.md" >}}). Let my work be my testimony.  
 
 At the begging of high school, I came across the need to write a mobile application. So I learned Flutter. Just it. After a week of studying, I made [my first hybrid app](/projects/#bookaseat).  
 
 Since then, I've made several Flutter projects and fallen in love again. Amongst all the technologies I got any contact with for the past few years, I find Flutter the first as gratifying as Django.  
 
 # Where I'm now  
 At the moment, I'm a high school student, looking forward to some commercial experience in software development. Especially in web and mobile development, but I'm not afraid of exploring new technologies of any kind. I even find myself slightly experienced in this field.
